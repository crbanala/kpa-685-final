            "['b\"Apparently Prides Osteria had a rough summer as evidenced by the almost empty dining room at 6:30 on a Friday night. However new blood in the kitchen seems to have revitalized the food from other customers recent visits. Waitstaff was warm but unobtrusive. By 8 pm or so when we left the bar was full and the dining room was much more lively than it had been. Perhaps Beverly residents prefer a later seating. \\\\n\\\\nAfter reading the mixed reviews of late I was a little tentative over our choice but luckily there was nothing to worry about in the food department. We started with the fried dough, burrata and prosciutto which were all lovely. Then although they don\\'t offer half portions of pasta we each ordered the entree size and split them. We chose the tagliatelle bolognese and a four cheese filled pasta in a creamy sauce with bacon, asparagus and grana frita. Both were very good. We split a secondi which was the special Berkshire pork secreto, which was described as a pork skirt steak with garlic potato pur\\\\xc3\\\\xa9e and romanesco broccoli (incorrectly described as a romanesco sauce). Some tables received bread before the meal but for some reason we did not. \\\\n\\\\nManagement also seems capable for when the tenants in the apartment above began playing basketball she intervened and also comped the tables a dessert. We ordered the apple dumpling with gelato and it was also quite tasty. Portions are not huge which I particularly like because I prefer to order courses. If you are someone who orders just a meal you may leave hungry depending on you appetite. Dining room was mostly younger crowd while the bar was definitely the over 40 set. Would recommend that the naysayers return to see the improvement although I personally don\\'t know the former glory to be able to compare. Easy access to downtown Salem without the crowds on this month of October.\"', \"b'This store is pretty good. Not as great as Walmart (or my preferred, Milford Target), but closer and in a easier area to get to.  \\\\nThe store itself is pretty clean and organized, the staff are friendly (most of the time), and BEST of all is the Self Checkout this store has! \\\\nGreat clearance sections throughout, and great prices on everything in the store, in general (they pricematch too!). \\\\nChristian, Debbie, Jen and Hanna are all very friendly, helpful, sensitive to all customer needs. Definitely one of the better Target locations in the area, and they do a GREAT job assisting customers for being such a busy store. Located directly in the Framingham Mall on Cochituate Rd / Route 30. 4 stars.'\", 'b\"I called WVM on the recommendation of a couple of friends who had used them in the past and thought they did a nice job. I\\'m a fan now, too.\\\\n\\\\nEvan and Cody showed up right on time for my move this past weekend. They were friendly and energetic, working quickly but carefully to get all my things moved out of the old place and into the new one in less than 2.5 hours. All of my (heavy) furniture arrived in perfect condition, and they took extra care not to scratch the wood floors in the process.\\\\n\\\\nI hope not to move again anytime soon, but next time I do, I\\'ll be calling WVM.\"', 'b\"I\\'ve stayed at many Marriott and Renaissance Marriott\\'s and this was a huge disappointment! The front desk and atrium is nice..there is a starbucks on site which is nice.\\\\n\\\\nThe rooms are run down and old.  There is a flat screen but that is to be expected of a Renaissance.\\\\n\\\\nWe got this hotel via Priceline at a rate of $75/night...good deal for the price but this is not a true Renaissance.\"', 'b\"The food is always great here. The service from both the manager as well as the staff is super. Only draw back of this restaurant is it\\'s super loud. If you can, snag a patio table!\"', \"b'This place used to be a cool, chill place. Now its a bunch of neanderthal bouncers hopped up on steroids acting like the can do whatever they want. There are so many better places in davis square where they are glad you are visiting their business. Sad that the burren is now the worst place in davis.'\", 'b\"The setting is perfectly adequate, and the food comes close.   The dining chains like Chilis and Victoria Station do barbecue better.\\\\n\\\\nIt\\'s no surprise you can always pick up coupons for Linwood at restaurant.com.\"', 'b\"Probably one of the better breakfast sandwiches I\\'ve ever had. I had the EGGMEATMUFFIN, the bread was toasted perfectly and the bacon was a real thick cut. Not that lame bacon we are more familiar with at your conventional breakfast diner. In addition, the place was clean and the staff was very helpful. The butcher had several different cuts available and was knowledgable as well as friendly. I left with some cuts of pork and beef and am excited to come back!\"', \"b'I am definitely a fan of Sports Authority.  This particular location has a good check in deal.  We came here near Christmas time to buy some presents and we had a good experience.  The staff members were very friendly and they helped us find what we were looking for.  We got some golf stuff, two pairs of shoes, a tennis racket bag, and some bicycle accessories.  The store was clean and well organized.  They have everything from apparel to basketballs and everything in between.  Good spot to buy athletic merchandise.'\", \"b'I work in the Pru and this is the most affordable and tasty place in the food court.  deals where a meal is $5-$7 and the chicken pesto is really good.   I am not a chowda person but all there soups I have had are pretty damn good.  Broccoli chicken is my favorite.  Also, probably the most personable Food court staff I have ever had the pleasure of ordering from.'\", \"b'They NEVER seem to get our \\\\norder correct, service is crappy, food is inconsistent and has gone down hill steadily in the last 6-9 months! WILL NEVER GO THERE AGAIN!'\", 'b\"Disappointing. Bolt is a follow up of Fanny\\'s Fabrics, which closed. Like Fanny\\'s, the selection is small. The fabrics lean toward contemporary. They also have a small stock of fabrics that you can order; however, they don\\'t have enough room to display their selections, so it\\'s like trying to paw through your closet when it has twice as many clothes as the racks were meant to handle. \\\\n\\\\nThe woman who works there most of the time is very nice and helpful. However, my mother and I both bought fabric there, and we both had the same problem: the employee helped us calculate our yardage without taking the repeat into consideration. I brought my pillow forms with me, so there was no doubt exactly how large they were. My mother was able to make her project work, but I came up a pillow short. By the time the pillows were made, I realized I was short, and I returned to Bolt (all in a month\\'s time), the fabric had sold out, with no plans on reordering. \\\\n\\\\nFortunately for me, I was just making a number of large throw pillows. Now I don\\'t have the number I wanted, but I can be flexible. What if this had been an upholstery job and my piece was partially completed? Obviously, unacceptable. My advise is to feel free and shop here, but figure out your measurements on your own.\"', 'b\"I have been here twice and have had really good food and service both times. I got a burger with caramelized onions, a red wine sauce and I believe blue cheese the first time. It was excellent and just the right size for me. I hate going out and ordering a burger that is bigger than my head that I can\\'t even finish half of! Flip\\'s burgers are about the same size I would make for myself at home.\\\\n\\\\nThe second time I went I had a limited time seasonal offering which was a venison burger with pea shoots, some kind of cheese that reminded me of brie, and a very sweet syrupy sauce which I could have done without, but overall it was very good. I also had onion rings and they were possibly the best onion rings I\\'ve had ever.\\\\n\\\\nThe only thing I don\\'t really like about Flip is the atmosphere and layout of the tables. I guess they were going for trendy upscale or whatever, but it makes me feel as if I am in a school cafeteria back in high school. I don\\'t like it. There are long white tables shoved up against each other with uncomfortable modern looking plastic chairs that kind of look like they came from Ikea. It\\'s also pretty loud in there because there is nothing to absorb the sound, like a school cafeteria.\\\\n\\\\nThe last time I was in there there were a couple of women with small children. I have no idea why someone would bring a child to Flip unless that child was a very adventerous eater. They don\\'t make anything plain. Everything on the menu has some pretty exotic ingredients. It\\'s also very pricy for burgers. This is the last place on Earth I would bring kids to eat. Burger King is right down the street.\"', 'b\\'I wish I could give them zero stars. The call takers are rude. The technicians are incompetent. The manager doesn\\\\\\'t know what customer service is. It is overpriced. I was quoted $230. I went to another locksmith, who actually got my lock off, and was quoted a total of $79.\\\\n\\\\nThe technician was late twice. He could not pick the lock which is not unusual and said he would have to drill through the lock. Ok. But, failed to bring charged batteries. He never offered to come back with charged batteries as soon as he could nor offered to send someone else. He said he could, however, come back around 10 hours later and do it \"under-the-table.\" Usually when you need to get a lock off, you need it off that minute. I said no. He charged me $30 for a service fee...a service that I never received. I contacted the manager, which seems to be a task in itself, and he said that I was rightfully charged $30 because I \"refused\" the technician\\\\\\'s offer to come back later. I doubt the manager knew it was an under-the-table payment. I still have not been reimbursed my $30!\\'', 'b\"This is a five-star restaurant if ever I have seen one!

I sat down at the bar while my boyfriend parked the car. Although the restaurant/bar was packed and LOUD, the bartender  (Vanessa) came over within a minute. Prompt service with a smile. When my boyfriend arrived a few minutes later, we didn\\'t see Vanessa behind the bar so we tried to flag down her male coworker. He was caught up watching the fight and it took a few minutes to get his attention - which is fine. Not fine, however, is that after I ordered a beer, he stood and texted for a few minutes before getting my beer and held his arm up to shield his texting from management lol. \\\\n\\\\nVanessa, however, is an excellent bartender!! As loud as it is in this place, she continually scanned the bar looking for people attempting to make eye contact with her for service.

I\\'ve only been once but I keep meaning to go back as it was so great (just a bit out of my way). \\\\n\\\\nI went with a fairly large group so we\\'d all ordered something different (back when it was $6 for everything, it looks like they\\'ve changed that now). At the time I got the chickpea fries, which were delicious but watch out for the fiber because I had to sit out of an entire board game. The board game selection was great, and I love that they serve mead (though I didn\\'t get any at 12 pm haha).  The molten lava chocolate cake was so, so good. Seriously.\\\\n\\\\nThe real topping to the experience (other than the great service and the fact that they put lemons in their complimentary ice water) was that they were playing Siouxsie and the Banshees in the background!

The staff were all extremely nice, remembered me like I was an old friend, and generally made me feel very comfortable. It\\'s also great that they have Saturday appointments. The evaluation, as with most lasik places, was complementary and all followup exams and treatments are included.  These exams are generally about 10 minutes.\\\\n\\\\nThe pre-surgery paperwork and going over post-op details, etc took about 30 minutes and the surgery itself (both eyes) took 25 minutes. Numbing drops are applied, so there is no pain, but while the flap is being created, there is an intense feeling of pressure from the suction that holds your eye still. I hated that. Afterward, the only pain I experienced was similar to getting soap in my eye, a kind of stinging. I went home and slept all night and woke up the next morning for my first followup and I could see! And had no more burning! I had some broken blood vessels from the suction used to hold my eye in place, but no pain all week, just dry eyes. The week following, you must avoid swimming, exercise, eye makeup, and have to sleep with goggles (so you don\\'t rub your eyes) and apply drops almost constantly. \\\\n\\\\nI believe I\\'ve made a great investment. I still can\\'t believe I\\'m going to see this well FOREVER! :-) \\\\n\\\\nMy only complaint was that they didn\\'t administer a sedative or anything to help me relax during the surgery (and maybe a pain Rx for after?) I didn\\'t feel nervous before it started, but a little panic hit me when my eye was being held open and I was asked to keep my eye very still.\\\\n\\\\nOh, and they charge $2100 per eye for the all-laser lasik.\"', 'b\"Almost desolate restaurant and dingy evironment.

No harm no foul. \\\\nThe foul part came when we entered our room. The carpet was soggy near the bathroom and the entire room was permeated with a musty smell. Something along the lines of aeu-de-someone-flooded-the-toilet. \\\\nAfter unpacking--which I shouldn\\\\\\'t have done, but I\\\\\\'m a sucker for any opportunity for sticking things out and making them work. We called the front desk. \\\\nShortly thereafter, a housekeeper appeared with a spray bottle to investigate. She agreed that the carpet needed to be cleaned (which would happen the following day), and began spritzing, what I can only assume to be anti-mold stuff? I didn\\\\\\'t ask--which clearly you can see from this point means I have some sort of timidness for communication. I really need to outgrow that. \\\\nLong story short, by the time she had hosed down the carpet, walls, and doorways with her spray bottle, we were left coughing and choking on the fumes and were forced to spend the night with the door open in a weak attempt to ventilate the room.\\\\nI did not leave my heart in FL. but I may have donated a small portion of lung tissue. \\\\nYou\\\\\\'re probably asking...\"but did you die?\" \\\\nI am very much alive.

Great spot to be seen. Food is just okay.'\", 'b\\'\"A Bit Embarrassed\"\\\\n\\\\nI\\\\\\'m not exactly sure where to start with this update, other than saying that my intention was absolutely NOT to get my - or everyone\\\\\\'s- meal comped last night.\\\\n\\\\nYes, I\\\\\\'m doing the Eat On $30 Challenge. Yes, I was swayed by another Yelper to go to Rosebud, even while fully aware that I didn\\\\\\'t want the $5 Mystery Monday meal (biscuits and gravy with a fried egg - looked good when I saw James H.\\\\\\'s, Emily R.\\\\\\'s and Alain L.\\\\\\'s orders, but just not something I really like at all) so I was probably getting myself into a grossly-tempting land of foodiness, given all the other things I know or think sound goody good on their menu. I went anyway!I wanted the company and I\\\\\\'m so used to dining out, I couldn\\\\\\'t resist, I suppose!!\\\\n\\\\nLong story short, the service was Capital-B Bad. BAD. Slow. Inattentive. As Lauren S. noted, no refills on water, plus other drinks were slow and things like James H.\\\\\\'s grits side and Emily R.\\\\\\'s fries were either forgotten (the former) or delayed and without steak sauce (the latter). Then, the first few folks to cash out clearly asked for separate checks, fiiiiiiinally got one that was all together, had to ask for it to be corrected . . . only to find that each one had a 20% \"service charge\" tacked on. Huh?! We all sat in the bar area, the group just kinda grew as people filtered in, and nowhere on the menu does it mention anything about an auto-add for \"big parties.\" Besides, I thought it was insulting because pretty much everyone at the table goes there a lot or at least often-enough to have talked with Ron and be a pretty familiar \"face\" - and we\\\\\\'re Yelpers, so we\\\\\\'re gonna tip you (oh, and PS? Not everyone ordered the $5 special, like Kathleen M. with her shrimp-n-grits or Lauren S. with her breakfast bowl . . . no one was gonna stiff them!).\\\\n\\\\nStill, our first three dining companions left without much fanfare, and I figured, \"hey, bad night.\" Then . . . the rest of us got ready to leave and a) our server took for-freakin\\\\\\'-ever to bring checks, and b) (the last straw in my book) dropped Emily R.\\\\\\'s to-go box on the floor, picked it up and resealed it, and dropped it in front of her like nothing had happened. Oh, did I mention that while we were waiting on our checks, we got to see several other servers (note: not ours) eating some of Ron\\\\\\'s wings at the bar with \"regulars\" (as he later described them)?? Yeah, it was a BAD night at Rosebud.\\\\n\\\\nSo when our server finally came back with the checks, I spoke up. My intention was to let him know that we were \"nonplussed\" and, as I stated to him, he should remove the \"automatic 20% service charge if he\\\\\\'d included it.\" A couple minutes later, Ron came out to \"chat.\"\\\\n\\\\nI have to say . . . I\\\\\\'m \"a little bit embarrassed\" because I\\\\\\'m not the diner who wants her meal comped for any little reason, or, really, ever, unless it\\\\\\'s a gracious gesture on management\\\\\\'s part. And when Ron came over, it felt, well, like our server had tattled to Daddy . . . and that Ron didn\\\\\\'t really want to hear what had happened. He said most of the right things, and \"agreed\" with comments, but suddenly I felt like I was the only one speaking up, he didn\\\\\\'t *really* care, he noted he\\\\\\'d worked \"80 or 90 hours\" in the last week (ok, but you\\\\\\'re the owner, right? The resto business is nothing close to easy . . . what does that have to do with our conversation??), and he tried to defend his server as well as justify the service charge . . . and then he said \"I can see where this is going . . . let me just take care of all of your dinners.\"\\\\n\\\\nWell, sh*t. Not really what I wanted to have happen. Honestly, it just seemed like an easy out to get *me* (us) to STHU. And then . . . how do I tip on a non-dinner? Especially one where I just had Bloody Mary\\\\\\'s once noting how sloooow everyone\\\\\\'s food orders came, despite being tempted? And do I just take it as a \"freebie\" given my week of Eat On $30 challengedom?? It was all too much. It seemed we all left awkwardly (not to mention that Kathleen, James, and Lauren had to pay, including a \"service charge\" and we didn\\\\\\'t) and while Emily \"tipped for me\" since I didn\\\\\\'t eat, but she knew I felt weird, I left with the overall thought . . . \"Huh?? What just happened??\"\\\\n\\\\nMonday. I will chalk it all up to Monday. I really like Rosebud and want to continue going often and recommending it to folks, but I left feeling -and still feel - like I need to *digest* my most recent experience . . .\\'', 'b\"This place has some of the BEST chinese take-out in Portland.

My co-workers went to Fred\\\\\\'s and had ordered and almost finished their food by the time I sat down at a table. I stuck it out in line though. The people behind the counter are very slow.

The service was great and it was an overall fantastic experience.  Will definitely be back.'\", 'b\\'Overall can be a great experience if you\\\\\\'re a regular and know what you are doing. You pick your car, get in, and you go. However for the rest of us like myself with family in toll, don\\\\\\'t expect much customer assistance. Upon arriving to the National garage at MCO, we did not see anyone in the attendant booth so we proceeded to \"choosing our car\" (I am an Emerald\\\\\\'s Club member so we got to pick any car from the respective lane). The caveat is I had a car seat reserved as well for my little one. After we chose our car and had my family inside our chosen vehicle (garage is located outdoors and it\\\\\\'s FL) I proceeded to head back to the attendant\\\\\\'s help for the car seat. Still no attendant, waited another 10 min before someone showed up. When he finally came back, no personal greetings and was a bit short when I asked about the car seat, he pointed to a pile of car seats on a shelf and walked away. Forget about any type of help with installation. Can be a bit tricky inside a covered garage (dark), an unfamiliar car seat, toddler crawling around the car and did I mention the FL weather...\\\\n\\\\nThe return was a breeze, you proceed to the designated lane and grab your stuff to go. The rep will hand you a receipt and you walk to the terminal.\\'', 'b\"For the price we paid (about $50 for 2 people) the food was only so-so and the service was AWFUL. Our waitress sounded like a robot, and we had to grab another waiter several times because she never came back to check on us. The food came out and it looked like it had been sitting in the back a while, it was barely warm and a film had formed over the top of my ravioli. Overall, very unimpressed and I don\\'t think I would go back or recommend this location to a friend.\"', \"b'Amazing Service!!! Very professional & courteous staff!!

Yelp led us to Comfort.   So worth it!\\\\n\\\\nThis is a new place, and I guess Watertown is giving them a hard time about signs, as they don\\'t have one yet.  To get there, find the Persian restaurant below and head up the stairs.\\\\n\\\\nThere\\'s a small bar (with a large TV) that opens into a lovely, warm dining room.  The ceiling is high and sloped, the exposed brick adorned with a small, gold threaded tapestry.  We were the only ones there, and got to sit by the window.\\\\n\\\\nWe were served by the owner, who was super nice and very attentive.  He really cared that we enjoyed our food, and seemed like an all around nice guy.\\\\n\\\\nI tried the mac and cheese, which was rich, flavorful and wonderful.  The green beans that accompanied it were cooked and seasoned well.  My cohort ordered buffalo wings and a salad.  I was able to try the latter, and was impressed at how fresh everything was.  He enjoyed his wings, which says a lot as he\\'s from Buffalo and is impossible to please when it comes to these things.  I was able to sample the blue cheese that came with the wings and was really impressed.  It wasn\\'t just blue cheese - I could distinctly taste gorgonzola in there.  I asked the owner about it, and he confirmed it.  He then added that pretty much everything (including said dressing) was made on site.  That says a lot, if you ask me.\\\\n\\\\nOh, and I\\'d like to thank the bartender for leaving off the sugar on my martini glass.  Sugar is like an unnecessary set of very sticky training wheels.  Three cheers for a decent lemon martini.\\\\n\\\\nWe were the only ones in the dining room tonight.  Don\\'t get me wrong, I loved the privacy and quiet of the empty room, but something tells me Comfort shouldn\\'t remain a secret.  Get thee to Comfort.  And while you\\'re at it, bring me back some of that blue cheese / gorgonzola yumminess.\"', \"b'Fix the Beer.  The hardware is the problem. At least 15 out of the 45 taps are faulty.

However, I have to give them props because it seems like they\\\\\\'re using Yelp in the right way - they\\\\\\'re using it to get a consensus and improve on things. I read about tomatillos a while ago online, and since then I\\\\\\'ve been curious to try it. After a productive study session, I went with a friend here for lunch. Their special sounded tempting, but after having seen their menu online, I\\\\\\'ve been dying to try their potato and green chile burrito, so that\\\\\\'s what I ordered. Since we were there for lunch, the guy at the counter told me they actually had a lunch special where for $8 you could get a burrito, chips and a drink. Sounded like a pretty good deal, so I got it. This is where I hand it to them. I assumed that all the extra toppings cost, well, extra, but there was no longer a price written next to them like there was on the menu I saw online. I then found out that they aren\\\\\\'t, so I also got roasted corn and avocado added to my burrito (I didn\\\\\\'t want to add too much and have the burrito be untenably huge!). My friend ordered a shrimp quesadilla and had like four extra toppings added to his.\\\\n\\\\nThere were a couple of minor things that bothered me. After ordering at the counter, I wasn\\\\\\'t sure if I was supposed to go up and get my burrito once they called it out, or if I was supposed to wait for someone to bring it to me. There\\\\\\'s nothing stated anywhere, and they surely didn\\\\\\'t say anything, so I just went up and got it. But then a couple after us had their food brought to them by the guy at the counter. Hmm. Odd. I was also kinda \"meh\" on the salsa at the table, and the chips that came with my lunch special. The chips tasted a little greasy to me, and the salsas just weren\\\\\\'t that great. I was expecting the tomatillo salsa to be amazing, considering the name of the restaurant was called tomatillos. Instead, it just tasted like they added waaaaaaaaay too much lime juice to me. I cannot remember a single thing about the red salsa, which just is a bad sign, considering I ate there like 3 hours ago.\\\\n\\\\nI will say though, that the potato and green chile was AMAZING. Definitely the best parts of the burrito were the very nicely seasoned potatoes, and the absolutely delicious blend of cheese they used inside. Pinto beans were nicely cooked, too. I\\\\\\'m kind of meh on the roasted corn, but since I didn\\\\\\'t pay extra, that wasn\\\\\\'t really a deal breaker for me.\\\\n\\\\nI definitely will be coming back here. They have ample parking, the space is really nice, and I really appreciate the fact that they seem to be doing their homework and improving what they can. I really think if they continue the way that they are, that this place will just get better with time.\\'', 'b\\'So my roommate borrowed my clock radio and apparently left it set to this station. This meant I got to wake up to my normal 7 a.m. radio alarm hearing some god awful \"dude-bro\"/man child apparently named \"Lunchbox\" YELLING literally at the top of his lungs. Gee, can you think of a more UNPLEASANT way to wake up at 7 a.m? I honestly think I would have rather woken up to a cheese grater across my face than listen to this frat-boy douche yelling like a 5 year old having a tantrum in the name of some morning show bit. Then one of the other hosts couldn\\\\\\'t even identify a Bon Jovi song playing? Are you kidding me? Where the hell did they find these people and please wherever it was send them back and get them off the damn radio or any job where they are actually required to speak for that matter. As for me I have re-adjusted my radio dial to a different station and banned my roommate from ever borrowing my clock radio again!\\'', 'b\\'It\\\\\\'s crazy how establishments on the west coast have so many more yelp reviews than places on the east coast.

Personally, I chose the mushroom rosemary gravy and I think that it was hands down the best gravy I had ever tried.\\\\n\\\\nI might has well licked the entire plate because it looked like it when I was finished.  The flavors were just right and I was shocked at the lack of greasiness that usual breakfast foods come with and their perfectly prepared dishes were done to my liking!\\\\n\\\\nLastly, make sure you order the biscuit too because it\\\\\\'s heaven baked in the oven for your enjoyment.\\\\n\\\\nTake care & savor it up!\\'', \"b'Perfect spices, nice atmosphere & music, great lighting and decor. Even the restroom area is pretty cool.  Will definitely come again.'\", \"b'Was not that great. We sat for like 15 mins before getting our drink orders done. We were literally the only table in the restaurant taken. We had like 3 different waiters. Appetizers all came out within like 5-10 min intervals of each other. All 3 of us ordered 2 different rolls and it took like 30 mins to come out. Sushi was alright but I would say to much for the quality.'\", 'b\"I think SideBar is the only restaurant downtown where you can have a 2 hour lunch and only spend 15 minutes of that actually eating and enjoying it.  The rest is spent waiting.  Mainly for grilled cheese, which apparently takes 45 minutes to make.  Maybe they were furiously Googling the ingredients or something?  Who knows.  But for some reason it took an ungodly amount of time and was last to the table.\\\\n\\\\nThe service was also slow, mainly because as our waitress noted, they don\\'t have trays so she couldn\\'t carry drinks or food for 4 people, which resulted in multiple runs back to the kitchen and bar.  Which is understandable because it TOTALLY makes sense to not have serving trays in a restaurant.  I mean, how out of place would that be?  Trays?  In a restaurant?  I can\\'t imagine.  That would be like having alcohol at a bar.  Too foreign a concept.\\\\n\\\\nAnyway.  I get it isn\\'t the best or classiest place downtown, so I cut it some slack, but an obscene wait for food and a borderline inept waitress are two things you don\\'t want to deal with on a Thursday when you are a hung over and hungry group because you all maybe had one martini too many the previous night.\"', 'b\"5 stars for the location, it\\'s absolutely wonderful. I ordered the shamrock bubble tea, which was one of the best I\\'ve ever had. I am subtracting a star for service however.  It was the barista that was so put out by waiting on us and then the 10-15 minutes it took to make the bubble tea... That\\'s a bit long for a drink.\"', 'b\"I come here to have my hair done by the amazing Elizabeth Eisenstein. She\\'s here until March 2016. So get here while she\\'s cheap!!

I am a fan of this place. I plan on coming back for facials with my mother next month.\"', 'b\"Located in the German Village, this Cup o Joe is the best in the chain, in my opinion.  A huge dessert selection and drink menu ensure that there\\'s something for everyone\\'s taste.  The atmosphere is casual, comfortable, and relaxing.

I wonder why the reviews were so low. I entered without looking at yelp initially but then after checking in and seeing the amount of stars I kind of grew the assumption that it wasn\\'t going to be good.  But it was really good. This was probably the best falafel wrap I ever had. They pressed the wrap too so it has a nice crunch but still soft to chew. The falafels weren\\'t bland and each bite tasted the same, which makes wraps great, since it\\'s evenly disturbed. \\\\n\\\\nThey are far from cheap on the stuffing so eat up! The wait time wasn\\'t long during their busy time and it\\'s a good portion for a hungry person, so I suggest checking this place out.\"', 'b\"If this isn\\'t your first time at the specialty coffee rodeo and if you know you\\'re way around a pour over, burr grinder, and espresso machine then most likely you will be slightly annoyed that the baristas talk to you like you\\'ve never heard of pour over and that they are the only place in Boston that serves good specialty coffee. I know coffee, am passionate about coffee, and Im always looking for the best roaster out there.  George Howell is a legend but the coffee here is honestly not that impressive.\\\\n\\\\nOne story - I ordered an Ethiopian pour over and asked for it to be made on the machine instead of by hand as I wanted to watch the machine in action. I paid $4 with my CC. I was then told that they don\\'t have any Ethiopian but they would make me Kenyan which is very similar (not in my opinion but ok I\\'ll go with it - there was Ethiopian on the shelf so I\\'m a little confused... why can you just go grab it and make it for me? That is what I ordered.)  Next I\\'m told they can\\'t use the machine because it isn\\'t on. Long story short I get my coffee after 10 minutes. And after drinking it I am never asked how it was, if I was ok with them switching out the coffee I ordered.  I don\\'t know about you but I expect more. \\\\n\\\\nI\\'ve decided that my coffee money is better spent elsewhere supporting people and roasters that are starting out.

Finally we were moved to another server\\'s section, who basically treated us like crap as well.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nI really can\\'t figure out why we stayed?  Cheap beer, I guess.

Sometimes, I just crave a really good burger and fries with a coke.  PDX Sliders delivered without the guilt. Their sliders are about three inches across, small, but packs a lot of flavor and satisfying.  My sister order the Morrison which was an herb-marinated chicken with bacon, pesto, baby arugula, and aioli on Ciabatta.  I ordered two, the Sellwood and Hawthorne--one to split with her.  The Sellwood consisted of a beef, patty, bacon, aged sheddar, caramelized onions, butter lettuce, aioli and the Hawthorne had a beef patty, bacon, goat cheese, strawberry preserves on Brioche.  Of course, she wanted to share the Hawthorne.  I took a bite of the Hawthorne first and didn\\'t want to give the rest to her.  It was so succulent!  The sweetness of the preserves with the tang of the goat cheese complimented the medium-rare beef patty well.  My sister didn\\'t care for the Morrison, she felt that it was something that she could\\'ve made at home and the Sellwood was delicious but very typical burger flavors.  Love that their truffle fries are super crispy!  I think there will be more Hawthorne burgers in my future. While sitting at the benches eating, I was surprise that they get a lot weird people constantly walking by for that area.\"', 'b\"My husband and I have done business with Beaverton Toyota 3 times and each time, they\\'ve blown me away at the service they\\'ve provided (I mean that in a good way). We\\'ve had the following salesman help us over the years - Mo Jafari, Salah Husein, and Drew (can\\'t remember his last name)....and we can\\'t forget the one who has always been the one to \\'make it all happen\\' - Josh Ford ( who was once the Sales Manager and now is a one of the Finance Managers). Each time we\\'ve gone in there, we presented them with some pretty tough challenges as to what we want to get out of and get in to, the negative equity that always seems to be involved, and the little down payment we never seem to have. But no matter how impossible our requests have seemed, they have always welcomed the challenges and have gone above and beyond to \\'make it happen\\' for us and make sure we leave their lot a happy (and returning) customer. Just to share an example: My husband wanted a car on a Subaru lot really bad! But that dealership wouldn\\'t give him the amount he wanted for his trade-in, so the numbers didn\\'t work, which means he couldn\\'t get the car. Well, when we told Beaverton Toyota about it, they went over to that Subaru lot, bought the car, brought it back to their lot, gave my husband what he was asking for his trade-in, and sold him the Subaru themselves! We were in shock and awe at how above and beyond they went. They don\\'t try to convince you to \\'settle for something else\\' because what you really want is too much of a challenge in making the numbers work. Their attitudes are \\'BRING IT!\\' When it comes to the sales part of their jobs, they aren\\'t pushy at all, annoying, or smothering, which I for one can highly appreciate as I HATE the car buying process (despite the fact that I\\'ve traded a car in almost every year for the past few years)! They show and express that they really care about what it is YOU want and also show that your safety and comfort (and that of your passengers) is important to them as well. They are always very patient (I speak from experience as I am not the easiest person to do business with), respectful, professional, and relaxed. If I ever had an issue with a car after purchasing it (which is rare), they are all over taking care of it like white on rice! \\\\nI brag about these guys to everyone I know. They deserve it. I\\'ve been to so many other dealerships and I\\'ve never have had the kind of experience with them that I do with Beaverton Toyota. I think, given all the cars I\\'ve had over the past few years, and the fact that I LOVE the Toyota they put me in to recently, it will be a long while before I do any car shopping. But if and when I decide to car shop again, I won\\'t be going anywhere else but there.\"', 'b\"What a gorgeous restaurant !

When we were about to pay, the server handed us a bill and I reminded her that we were using the 1/2 off Scoutmob deal, so she took the bill back and came back with another that was pretty much the same except $8 difference...REALLY?!? She added the 18% tax but also a so-called Scoutmob fee...RIDICULOUS!!!!'\", 'b\"Let me start by saying this place is lucky my girlfriend isn\\'t the one reviewing it because she is far harsher.\\\\n\\\\nDecor works.  You feel like you\\'re in a down home bbq joint.  Mission accomplished.  I liked the menu and its simplicity as well. (although there was some confusion on the combo in that ribs and wings were not an option although they appeared to be.)\\\\n\\\\nMy first issue was with the burnt ends.  I came here for the burnt ends, because FYI, it is very hard to find burnt ends around Atlanta.  this place offered them so I came.  They were sub par in my opinion.  They were 1.5 inch cubes of dry brisket black on all sides.  This is not the burnt ends I know and love.  Definite disappointment when that was my sole purpose for coming there.\\\\n\\\\nOther lackluster food: the brunswick stew was just okay... tasted and looked like something you would get out of a can.  The potato salad had pretty much no flavor and the potato seemed slightly undercooked.\\\\n\\\\nThe good food:  I really enjoyed the okra.  I love okra, and whenever I order fried okra I assume it\\'s going to be sliced and in corn meal.  However, they fry it whole and in almost a tempura type batter.  Very different and very tasty.  We ordered some wings and they were very good.  They\\'re smoked and then flash fried so they are flavorful and juicy.  However, I recommend getting them in a sauce because the dry rub just isn\\'t enough.  The pulled pork was also very good, but a little dry like it was pulled long before I ordered it.\\\\n\\\\nOn top of food shortcomings, there were several service issues.  The server, although very nice and polite,. was the only server working the lunch shift.  So she was obviously overwhelmed by five or six tables.  On top of that, our bill was mixed with the table next to us so when I got my bill it was over 80 dollars for the two of us.  She fixed it, but it caused a longer delay than there already was.  The service issues really weren\\'t her fault, but management for only having one server, that was also acting as the bartender.\\\\n\\\\nIf I\\'m in the area and needing some bbq I would definitely come here again.  Just a disappointment when I came out of the way for burnt ends that were not great.\"', 'b\"Good may have been good if my server Megan T actually used a pad and took people\\'s orders instead of guessing and just putting whatever she thought you wanted in front of you. Manager offered discounts because everyone else in my party ate but me, and still charged me for bad food. Stay away. Place next door (Hennessy\\'s) had great food and specials. Thanks for charging me for food I didn\\'t eat and trying to pacify me with discounts you never applied. Boo.....boo......on the right side theTV\\'s are in good spots to watches you eat.....well try to eat\"']\n",

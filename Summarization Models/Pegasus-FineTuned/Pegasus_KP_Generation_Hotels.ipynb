The pillows are odd - 1 is not puffy enough, but 2 are too puffy. Not a dealbreaker though. \\n\\nKitchen has set of 6-8 plates/mugs/glasses. (No wine glasses). A pan and a large pot. Utensils and a few knives, cutting board and a corkscrew. No peeler. Kitchen includes sponge, Dawn and dishwasher liquid. Target is right next door, and sells all groceries. SUPER CHEAP.

Saves so much $. \\n\\nNice dining table, and living room. We had no issues with the place, except that the housekeeping was not that great. Towels weren\\'t replaced, nor were toiletries until we asked a third time. Hair was on the floor, and didn\\'t get wiped up.

              " \"Let's be honest: we all know that when I travel, I don't often do hotels. I find them too spacious, too open, and definitely too expensive for my solo traveler budget. Instead, I usually opt for Airbnb rentals because they afford me more freedom and local insight, and less pain on my already-stretched checking account.\\n\\nI arrived in the politely festive lobby of the Best Western Premier after a rough three days: I had been up at the crack of dawn to tour NASA, sat around in the cold Florida dawn light to watch a 'scrubbed' launch, and finally watched Orion take flight. I had been up at what my body considered prime sleeping time (between 1:00am and 3:00am Seattle time) for three mornings in a row, and done a fair amount of other fun stuff too!  All I really wanted was sleep, but heck, with a quaint lobby like this, who was I to turn down the opportunity for a great interior panorama?\\n\\nThe ladies at the front desk were prompt and helpful; they checked me in, acquainted me with the property via a map, and called my contact in the marketing office to come over and say hello. I gratefully collapsed into a big lounge chair with a glass of water for a quick chat before heading off to my villa. My. Villa.\\n\\nI've stayed in hotel rooms and I've stayed in suites, but nothing compares to the space you get with a villa. It's basically like having your own townhouse, and you don't even have to clean it after you leave! My two-bedroom king loft villa was immaculate; I wistfully eyed the ground-floor bedroom before taking some photos, and retrieving my belongings from the rental car. I climbed the stairs to the loft, weary, and proceeded to climb straight into bed for a nap.\\n\\nWaking up an alarmingly short time later, I made my way to the lobby restaurant to try and find  dinner. Over salad and delicious fresh-made pizza, I chatted with the lady bartender and a fellow guest. The restaurant was empty otherwise, so we both sat at the bar. I would imagine, being family focused, most dinners are quiet affairs since families are dining out and about; breakfast on the other hand, is probably a flurry of pre-park fueling.\\n\\nI returned to my room, re-packed my bags, snuggled back into bed and eventually slipped into a blissful sleep. The bed was barely disturbed when I climbed out in the morning-in part because of my deep sleep, but also because I simply can't take up an entire king-size bed, no matter how hard I try. I showered, packed the car, grabbed a few slices of left-over pizza, and went to explore the rest of the grounds.\\n\\nOne of my favorite things discovered during my morning walk was the beautiful way in which this property has taken advantage of the local ecosystem-while I have no doubt that the lakes which take up major interior portions of the grounds were re-shaped by humans, they allow one to feel the sense of being near the swamps and everglades. Signs on the walkways warn about not feeding alligators, and beautiful flowers bloom on freshly-watered bushes. The morning sun was weak and winter-like, but the temperature was comfortable, and being among the trees was refreshing.\\n\\nOther things I really appreciated about the Best Western Premier Saratoga Resort Villas:\\n\\n- The play-park just across the street from my villa which is part of the grounds. This is perfect for families with children who don't get completely exhausted by Disney and Universal Studios.\\n- The pool and hot tub, which are also handicap accessible. Great detail there, and I'm sure the pool is well-loved during Florida summers.\\n- The kitchen setup which includes a sponge and dish soap. Too many places I've stayed remember one but not the other. Both are necessary for surviving long stays in a vacation space.\": 4.0,\n",

It was very spacious for us two, and we had our own little kitchen. What I did not like was there was no pots or pans, but then again we were on vacation so we did not needed those. I did use their utensils, a fork specifically , all the forks there was already stained with leftover food. So all these utensils were not washed properly for the guests.. After that I refused to use anything else from the hotel. I noticed that the water glasses had stains on them too. So much for housekeeping. Another thing I noticed from this villa is that the stairs are very creaky when going up and down. It sounded like something from a horror movie. Although we had a two bedroom villa, we only stayed in one bedroom, obviously the king sized. The bed was nicely made but it sort of have a musty smell which I did not like. I also saw some sort of faded black stains on the blanket that made me uncomfortable. But the worse thing about this hotel was the foul smelling water. I don't know if other guests can sense it but I was able to smell it the moment I took a shower. It didn't smell like clean water, it smelled very sour and gross. I had to drive to the nearest Walmart to buy a gallon of water because I refuse to wash my teeth with their water. I guess you get what you paid for.

While you can certainly drive up to the parking lot of the mansion, there is also a beautiful hike from the city that takes you to the top of the grounds in an hour. I started my hike at the entrance of Lower Macleay Park. I walked on the Lower Macleay trail to the Wildwood Trail. As you walk, you will see a Stone House on the right. You need to continue straight and follow the switchbacks to the Upper Macleay Trailhead then follow the signs pointing you to the mansion. It is my favorite hike within the city. However, I wish I did it in warmer weather. As the temperature during the week was below freezing, there were entire parts of the trail that were covered with ice. I was also wearing old running shoes that did not have much grip left. Consequently, I slipped and wiped out three times. During one of those times, the path was downhill so I sat down and slid down because I knew I would wipe out if I tried to walk anyway. On another segment on the hike up, I was struggling and grabbing on to branches to pull myself up. A girl walked by and asked if I was \"ok\" then immediately wiped out and fell on her rear end. Her companion laughed hysterically at her. He explained that he is \"not a bad person\" and he only laughed because he had already fallen 5 times and it was only her first time falling. As I made my way up to the mansion, I realized I had already tried my luck a lot. As a result, I decided to take a cab back to the bottom where I parked. The $10 fee was well worth avoiding a potential broken arm if I fell hard. There is also a limited amount of parking at the entrance of Lower Macleay Park. There is street parking nearby but it is a 2 hour limit. Without losing some time to navigate the ice, I definitely could have made the round trip and enjoyed the view in less than 2 hours.

              " \"This place is many things. Let's start with the most superficial.\\n\\nAs of right now, historical significance aside, this is an imposing, rather pretty (if not beautiful or lovely) and perfectly gigantic old home you can walk around in for less than the cost of a movie. The gardens are thoughtfully planned, well-tended, and planted with colorful and interesting specimens. You get a breathtaking view of Mt Hood and downtown from across the front yard.\\n\\nIt's easy to find parking once you're here, the staff is nice, the prices are fair, and the drive in is very scenic. I can personally vouch for the reality of it being a great tour of fine west hills homes if you're chatting away in the truck and not paying attention on your way into town and end up zig-zagging across the Tualatin Mountains trying to find a back way in. \\n\\nMoving on to the symbol of civic pride that a place like this can represent, it's really cool how real estate developers were thwarted by public fund-raising 50 years ago. The Columbus Day Storm crushed the whole town, but the headlines about the damage to this place spurred a wave of donation that put together the $225K ($1.6M today) to snap this place up off the market. In Seattle (where I live), the real estate developer wins this fight every. Single. Time. PDX did it right saving this grand old manse from the bulldozer. It's been a park for generations now, so this feels like a given but that moment of collective consciousness speaks well of this town. Sorry, developers.\\n\\nHistorically, there's great significance here. 16,000 square feet of sandstone, marble, steamed and shaped oak flooring, and countless dozens of other interesting materials went into it, and the results are stylish and striking in many ways. There's central heat, central vacuum (in the 1910s? really?), an intercom, an elevator, and lots of other stuff you would 't expected to find as original fixtures in many houses a century old. \\n\\nThe designs here are gorgeous, flowing curved and straight halls together through oval, circular, square and rectangular rooms that build out of each other like fractals. The music room, past the 1880s Steinway and the old harp, has a mesmerizing Mt Hood view. The turkish smoking room has unbelievably ornate ceilings. The built-in service areas and cupboards in the dining room are nicer than most freestanding furniture I've seen. The kitchen floor is like nothing else I've ever seen. The furniture is a bit on the fussy side for the most part, but the thorough details of innovation here are amazing--the 100-year-old master shower has 8 shower heads. These people really knew how to live. Or at least they really knew how to hire people who could show them how to live.\\n\\nFinally, this house represents a manifestation of a lifetime's work. The printed materials available here make it clear that Henry Pittock made a ton of money helping out the community (they briefly mention that he owned many businesses). He was spry and fit until late in life, but still lived only five years here after it was completed. Still, it's hard to imagine many finer houses anywhere in 1914. The legacy of the self-made man who carved out a life for himself and his family in the west can't be expressed any more opulently than it is here. You get a sense of the home life lived, you get a sense of life for the other half, you get a sense of the times, the design, the style, the architecture.\\n\\nAnd most of all you get a sense of what gets built when someone builds whatever he wants wherever he wants.

This last time I sprang for the $19 (whopping) Behind the Scenes tour. This was NOT worth the money. You go in a circle underneath the house and you get to see the background operational part of the business (whoop-te-do) complete with messy desks and many messy storage rooms. The guide pointed out boxes of xmas ornaments and all the fake trees lined up for the upcoming decorations for xmas. Oh, and you witness the mega old boiler and old internal vacuum system. The guy we had was long winded on not-so-interesting anecdotes. Then we went up to the top floors and got to see... wait for it... more storage rooms!

Consider carpooling.  And restorations are still being done, so go drop some coin and help them out.   Sure, the pictures are cool, but it's not the same as experiencing Pittock Mansion as a place. Designer or not, local or visitor, it's a building to see once in your lifetime.\\n\\nBut how do you review a building, let alone a local monument? To critique architecture is to understand that there is a difference between space and place, or what you can actually touch and what your soul feels.  The careful balance of the pair is what makes a building memorable, and to many, what has made Pittock Mansion Portland's most recognized house and also its most cherished home. \\n\\nThe four story building is constructed in the Renaissance Revival style, meaning that the house doesn't necessarily resemble one type of structure, but rather the romanticized ideas behind different European building techniques.  The steep roof and grand staircase mimic those of French castles and many of the interior elements are akin to Turkish details.  Be sure to walk around the servant gate lodge, which resembles picturesque Italian manners of the late 1800s.  If you can't get to Europe, let alone out of the northwest, this is a pretty good glimpse at what you'd see. But unlike other period structures, Pittock was designed with a small footprint, taking up little of the 46 acre site.  The use of local and regional materials, and constructed to preserve much of the surrounding landscape makes it so very Portland.  You almost have to wonder, are we talking about a historic mansion, or the values rooted in many contemporary, sustainable buildings designed in town?  \\n\\nThere's something to be said about the people who envisioned such a residence.  Who, as children, walked across the entire USA to the northwest, humbly built themselves up through service and work, and were finally able to create their home in the later part of their lives.  Hard work pays off, and this is a fine reminder.  It's enough to send chills down your spine when you stand at the edge of the paved walkway, and your realize how everything you see, from the grass blades at your feet to the Mt. Hood in the distance has evolved into the world we know today.

              " 'Pittock Mansion was the home of Portland pioneers Henry and Georgiana Pittock during 1914-1919. It sits on 46 acres of land and is about 1,000 feet above sea level. (Drink lots of water and take your time hiking up). The Pittock family lived there until 1958. They had planned on selling the estate. When land developers wanted to demolish it and there was extensive storm damage, the City of Portland purchased the house and it has been a Portland historic landmark since 1965.  \\n\\nIt costs $8.50 (adults) to view the mansion and worth every penny. Each room has been beautifully restored as if it were 1914 again. I loved all the hard work and craftsmanship put into building this house. Walking through the inside of the mansion makes me imagine what life was like in the early 1900\\'s, before technology. The house had an intercom system (they need it, with all those rooms!), an elevator, vaccuum system, and a few \"modern\" touches for its days. It incorporated Turkish, French, and Italian designs.  My favorite room was the Music room. I loved the French-Renaissance decor, the student harp, and of course, the antique brown Steinway grand piano. It\\'s not a music room without the Steinway. \\n\\nOutside, the grounds are lovely. They\\'re well maintained and cared for, with lots of flowers and greenery. There are a few benches and observation binoculars for peering over downtown Portland. On a clear day, you can see Mount Hood in the distance.

You are teased with a glass door to a secondary stairwell and a sign advertising 'behind-the-scenes' tours, which apparently are only offered one day per month, and at a premium that more than doubles the admission cost.  Not being familiar with the rigors and costs associated with operating and maintaining such an attraction, I still can't help but wonder why they can't offer this special access on a more frequent basis.\": 4.0,\n",

I remember it being the finish line for the 13th season of The Amazing Race.\\n\\nThe Pittocks were a wealthy family. Henry Pittock and his wife Georgiana owned The Oregonian, a daily newspaper that is still printed today. Aside from being a newspaper publisher, Henry was also a businessman who invested in real estate, banking, railroads, and mining, among others. On the other hand, Georgiana raised funds for many charities.\\n\\nConstruction of the Pittock Mansion began in 1912. Henry and Georgiana moved into the home in 1914 with other members of the family. However, the couple lived in the Mansion for only four years before they died. Georgiana died in 1918 at the age of 72, and Henry in 1919 at 84. Some family members continued to live in the home into the 1950s. The Mansion was heavily damaged by a storm in 1962. In 1964, developers wanted to tear the house down and turn the estate into a subdivision, but Portland citizens rallied and raised funds to purchase the property. In 1965, the Pittock Mansion opened to the public as a historic house museum.\\n\\nFor $12, the self-guided tour allows visitors access to almost every part of the house. The Mansion has 23 rooms that include a Library, Music Room, Turkish Smoking Room, Sewing Room, five large bedrooms, and two sleeping porches.\\n\\nThe third floor is not open to the public due to safety concerns. It has three servants\\' bedrooms, a bathroom, and a storage room. There is a \"secret\" stairway in the central wing that is also not open to the public. This stairway reaches all levels of the Mansion and enables the staff to perform their duties unobtrusively. The elevator was for the family\\'s use only.\\n\\nIt is a shame that Henry and Georgiana did not live long enough to enjoy the home they had built. Rumor has it that the Pittocks\\' spirits still remain in the Mansion.\\n\\nThe park towards the back of the house (facing east) offers a phenomenal view of Portland... for free! On a clear day, you can see five Cascade Mountains: Mount Hood, Mount St. Helens, Mount Adams, Mount Rainier, and Mount Jefferson.\\n\\nI am a huge fan of old houses, hence I am giving Pittock Mansion five stars.

It's not difficult at all to find your way around.

Also, the elevators were only on one side of the hotel, so if you're staying on the other side, you had to cross over the outside walkways to get to them.

I know the difference.\\n\\nI find Doubletee hotels to be maddening in that the Doubletree brand has to have the most inconsistent quality from hotel to hotel of any hotel brand I am familiar with.  \\n\\nIn one hotel, a Doubletree will be very nice.  In another, it will be some refurbished mess that is one coat of paint and new carpet from being a two-decade-old Raddison. \\n\\nThis particular hotel is not nice by Doubletree standards.  From the look of the place, it seems like an old re-done and re-branded Embassy Suites.  You can see where they just put a thin, poorly-done coat of paint over everything to try to spruce the place up.  But everything is still old, dated, and worn.\\n\\nThe carpet is old.  In the rooms, the bathrooms are old.  Generally, this is a remodeled hotel remodeled on an obvious budget.  Have you seen a \"flip this house\" type show where the renovator comes in and spends as little as possible on the lowest possible quality to get a house up in value to flip?  You feel that someone did that with this hotel to put the Doubletree brand on it and charge a little more in rent than they could get away with if it were a lesser brand.\\n\\nOn top of that, it is pretty clear this hotel has cut a deal with the pilots of some airline. The place was covered up in pilots and stewardesses.  The hotel shuttle is reserved for them and you can\\'t use it unless they are not using it to get to and from the airport. Of course, this means a large portion of the people staying at this hotel are not paying for their own rooms, don\\'t have much say in where they stay, and are not using amenities that a business traveler might use.  The fact that such a large percentage of the rooms seem to be used in this way is reflected in the hotel. \\n\\nNo cab stand,  you have to have them call a cab for you.\\n\\nThe warm cookies are a gimmick. That should not be the best thing a hotel has going for it.\\n\\nThey advertise free wifi, but then charge you to get decent speeds.  Hotels should not charge for wifi.  \\n\\nSundry shop won\\'t let you use a credit card unless you spend 5.00.  That\\'s bush league.\\n\\nThe staff was nice and the young college-looking kid who checked me in broke the speed record for checking me in.  \\n\\nThere is a general cigarette smell to this place.\\n\\nIf you are on the east side of the hotel, you have to walk a long way from the elevators to get to your room, or cut across an outdoor pavilion.  If you have  room facing the outdoor pavilion, you\\'ll have people walking by your door rolling their luggage over bumpy floors all night.  \\n\\nThere are lots of hotels in Austin that are similarly priced, and even a couple with the exact same brand nearby.

              " \"Beware of service! Shitty staff.  Beautiful hotel.\\n\\nAs a Hilton diamond member,  I usually prefer to check in at the desk.  With this, one is able to get a feel for the staff and take advantage of the water,  cookies, and at times free breakfast vouchers (these are usually forgotten if you take advantage of the digital check in).  Additionally,  if requested, and the hotel is not fully booked,  they may have upgrades available.  Whereas,  digital check-in past experiences have never offered upgraded rooms.\\n\\nMy experience is as follows:\\n\\nI had arrived at the front desk around 2:00-2:30pm.\\nI stood in line as the front desk helped and checked in another diamond member (they spoke loud enough that I could hear their whole conversation).  There were three staff members standing at the front,  on person was assisting a guest,  one other (the manager) was on the phone,  and last a person standing doing nothing.  The person standing,  doing nothing,  asks if I've been helped.  I respond no.  She then does nothing.  I figured maybe she wasn't part of the front desk.  The lady has me waiting until the manager sees me standing there,  asks if I've been helped.  I respond no,  and she asks the lady who is doing absolutely nothing,  knowing I haven't been helped,  to assist me.  I give her my drivers license and asked if I could check in.  She literally stares at my license for a few minutes (not the computer) and says I have nothing available.  I'm okay with this but,  how the hell does she know nothing is available without even looking it up?  Mind you this lady was rude from the get-go!    I walked outside,  confused,  looked on my phone app,  checked in on my phone,  and immediately got a room.  I head back inside, wait for my brother who bought us food from Papadeaux.  While sitting at the couch at the lobby,  I see they're checking people in.\\nThe app says your room is ready!  I finish my Pappadeaux meal in the courtyard and head up to a clean available room.  The idiot lied.  I head back down to complain to the manager.  She plays the empathetic role.  The only thing in my mind the lady would be rude to me was that my skin was a different color.  I simply cannot think of another reason.  The hotel literally helped the person ahead of me and people coming after me.  Why not me?\\nThe very next morning,  I told them I was a diamond member and asked if I could have an extended checkout to wrap up my meetings and reports.  The lady at the front said I had 15 minutes.  I called back to verify (because usually,  I have until 1-2:00pm)and they immediately placed me on hold and left me there.\\n\\nThe treatment was so terrible that it had to be noted.

The elevators are worn out and take way too long to get you from floor to floor, the decor is pretty dated and the overall vibe is mediocre. The room I stayed in was a king size room that was huge.  The room was huge but the carpet was worn and torn and the decor was missing from this room.  Not much color or anything to look at.  For a giant room the closet was ridiculously small, the bathroom was pretty old and sketchy.  The tile i the bathroom was cracked, the shower head was stuck at an odd angle and the toilet makes a banging sound when flushed.\\n\\nThe cafe/restaurant:\\nThe breakfast was OK, I ordered an omelet and it was just decent and comes without any sides.  The sides are served buffet style and this is where the experience goes downhill.  The fruit available was only cantaloupe, no blueberries or strawberries or bananas.  The signage for the meat and potato sides were nearly all wrong and you got to sort of investigate what you may be selecting. I opted out of the sides, they did not look appetizing. I ate the omelet and did not return for breakfast the remainder of my 4 night stay.\\n\\nDinner:\\nI tried to eat across the street at Papadeux\\'s but the wait was 45 minutes or longer and I had work to get done.  I went back to the Doubletree and they were serving dinner in the lounge.  I ordered the crabcake as an appetizer and the blackened redfish. This meal and the service was terrible.

My redfish is served first by someone other than my waitress who is dropping off plates to nearby tables. The fish is cold, the rice is cold and the asparagus was cold and rubbery. They had some green salty sauce on it that was just way too salty to eat. Need more water, no waitress to be found.  She then shows up with my appetizer, a cold crabcake on a plate with a side salad sort of mix with no dressing or anything.  This is just a plate with a big cold crabcake and no sauces or anything.  I ask for more water.  Another 15 -20 minutes goes by and nothing, I find her and plead to get my check so I can leave.  This place is freaking awful, these are not real restaurant servers.

After a couple of days, I called Budget regarding the battery and was told they would send roadside assistance to look at the problem, but I would need to pay if they were able to resolve the problem without having to bring the car in for a repair.  Now, why would I need to pay for a problem with their car that I did not cause?  Simple, I did not purchase the roadside assistance insurance, which does not make sense. So, the next day I went to a nearby Budget to see if I could exchange the car and was told they did not have another car available, but I could drive it back to the airport for an exchange.

So we made those arrangements, keep in mind a little over a month in advance. They misspelled my name and email address. I never got a confirmation but it\\'s ironic that they charged $300 right away. My first issue was the upfront charge. They are supposed to ask if you want to pay right away or when you pick up the vehicle. They just took my money and I was confused. It got so much worse when I called and they said I didn\\'t have a reservation. I began to get frustrated so after about a half hour they somehow find me through the dates of travel and this man simply says \"oh your name was not spelled right, and neither is your email\", so I went ahead and gave him all my info...again. still no email.

He said the only way to fix it was to cancel the whole thing and start over. So, by then I assume he\\'s going to cancel for me and rebook because it\\'s common sense, right? WRONG! Not here at budget. He said ok and hung up! So then I call back and now I have nothing. By this time I\\'m a couple days away from my trip and I have no car reservation. So then the price goes from $300 to $196 wow. That\\'s amazing. After telling him what I went through.

I was ready to pay taxes and gas, but tell me why the gas was a mere 30 something and my total went from $196 to $371! I\\'m very disappointed and I hope that you all read this and share my story. Please avoid the headache and go through Enterprise or someone else you can trust. This company lacks training, people skills, and patience, not to mention integrity! They\\'re thieves and liars.

I set up the pickup time at 6:40PM, and our plane arrived early and we were in line by 6:30. We waited in line for 1hour 40 minutes and all of this was due to two things; out of the 10 terminals they had Budget only had 3 people working and the workers were very poorly trained. The line kept growing and growing out into the airport aisles. Quick look at the other rental car places and they had some lines too, all of which cleared in about 20 minutes while we just waited. We got up to the counter at 8:10, after 1 hour 40 minutes in line.\\n\\nAt the counter she kept wanting us to pay for insurance.  Over and over I told her we didn\\'t need more insurance but she kept trying to sell it. She kept leaving to go in the back to discuss with someone - she did this several times just leaving us standing there. Finally she processed the first car and needed me to still use a credit card \"hold\" in case they had to charge more - ok I used my card and she gave us all the paperwork (at this point time at Budget = 2 hours). \\n\\nThen she started working on the second vehicle (minivan). I tried to use the same credit card for the \"hold\" she told me that I couldn\\'t pay for both. I told her that I specifically called instead of booking online because I wanted to make certain I could pay for both. Back and forth, she kept telling me she couldn\\'t do it. Finally my son said he would use his card (I would pay him back if need be). This is when we found out they won\\'t take debit cards, and that was all he had. Back and forth to the back room for what seemed like hours, she finally came back with the manager. The manager told her it was totally fine for me to use my card but to set up my son as the second driver (which is what we had been asking for anyway). She tried doing this for several minutes and then suddenly left to go back to the back room. After another 20 minutes or so she finally came out and was just standing at a different terminal by the back room. My son went to ask her what was going on, and she admitted that she accidentally cancelled the reservation and their system gave away our minivan, they had no others. So now we had to wait for a minivan to be turned in. After another very long wait they had one, and confirmed setup because we had asked for 2 booster and 1 child seats. She gave us all the paper work and told us where to go to get the vehicles. Total time at Budget at this point = 3 hours. So we go upstairs, across a bridge and then made our way to the Budget lot, where both cars were parked. We opened the minivan - no booster or child seats. After all of this, my family (with one child under 2 and two aged 6 and 7) were burnt out, so frustrated and unable to do anything about it. We had to walk back to a smaller service area, where a guy behind the counter came out and took us a few hundred feet to a shed that had seats in it. He then just handed them to us and we carried them all back and installed them. Total time = 3.5 hours. \\nAfter we got back home, I called what was listed as the corporate complaint line (it\\'s actually just the regular Budget number). After describing the entire fiasco, the lack of people working, the lack of knowledge they had, and the mistake she made that added over an hour to our wait - he looked into the time loaded in their system. He then tried to blame us, since our reservation time was 6:40 and we did not check in until 8:10. I explained that we were in line at our time and the line, created by their lack of workers and incompetence was why it took that long. At this point he told me the best he could do was a $40 coupon for our next rental with Budget. I told him that we would never rent from Budget again, so he said he could do a $40 refund. We spent over $1000 and the best was $40? I asked to speak to his manager. He said that the best he could do was $50. I asked again for his manager, and he asked how much would it take. I told him I would like to see at least 20% and he said in no way could he do that. I again asked for his manager, he put me on hold and finally sent me to his manager. \\n\\nRecounted the story to the manager, and I got the same $50 offer. Asked for the manager\\'s manager and was put right through. Recount the story again and she started looking at the check in times and what we reserved. She told me that their refunds are based on their system wait time, and since she showed us checking in at 8:10 she could not count the time before that. Crazy. Anyway she told me that the best she could do was $40 per vehicle, so a total of $80. She couldn\\'t do anything else for me take it or leave it. Of course I took it but I told her I wasn\\'t through.\\n\\nWriting this review in the hope that others see it and not rent from this Budget.

Check a display board for your name and the location of your vehicle.  Check the car for damages and note them if necessary.  Since the keys are in the car, you may hop in and take off.

That waiting time is understandable because airport car rental companies tend to have a lot of customers. What really bothered me was the customer service. We worked with an agent who tried to force us to get supplementary liability insurance; he did not want to take \"no\" as an answer. As far as I understand, it is up to the customer to make this decision, at our own acknowledged risk. After about ten minutes of back-and-forth conversation and annoyed looks from this agent, he finally accepted our decision, but we had to be VERY firm. His motivation for us to get the insurance was clearly not for our own protection and safety but for the rental company to make more money. The conversation would\\'ve had a different tone if the Budget agent had actually been motivated by our well-being. After finally accepting our decision, the agent proceeded to ask us if we wanted to prefill our gas. My husband asked me what I thought about that, and I replied that I usually fill it up myself. Without looking at me, the agent told my husband that he didn\\'t need to ask me for my permission. I was shocked and upset to say the least.\\n\\nOn top of poor customer service, when we arrived to our vehicle, there was a large piece of bumper debris sitting in our trunk (picture attached). We walked back to the agent desk to ask what we should do, but first had to wait for him to finish up with another customer who was having problems with their reservation (didn\\'t seem to be just us!). When we got to the agent, he replied, \"It\\'s not something I can control,\" and sent us back to the car. Confused, we returned to the car, where we took a more thorough look, and noticed that the front bumper was damaged and almost dragging on the ground. We REALLY didn\\'t feel comfortable driving that car at that point, went back again, and told the agent definitively that we didn\\'t want to drive that car. He asked us who first assigned us to the car (we said, \"you!\"). It seems that he had forgotten. Finally, he allowed us to switch cars, but refused to give us a discount for the inconvenience.\\n\\nAll the extra trouble added about an hr to our already late evening.

I rented from Budget at other airports with no issue but there are issues at MCO. \\n\\nOne of the issues is that they accept \"mileage points\" which increase the # of reservations at this location hence the long lines. I waited 2 full hours for my car & by the time I got to the counter, my options were either a pick up truck or a mid-size SUV. I jumped at the SUV before another person could get it.

Here are some tips:\\n\\nMost Budget agents here or at least the \"one\" I got was nice and competent. It must sux to work here. She was professional and did not pressed me to pay extras. Just be firm and you are fine.\\n\\n1. On arrival, there is a Terminal A & Terminal B with the same duplicate car rental counters at MCO. If the line is huge at Terminal B, the line could be shorter at Terminal A. Just have someone walk over and see. After I stood in line at Terminal B for 2 hours, I was told to pick up my SUV vehicle across the airport at Terminal A\\'s parking lot only to learn the car rental counter line at Terminal A was 1/2 the size of Terminal B.\\n\\n2. Have quarters in your car when you drive in Orlando. There is a North Fork bank at MCO airport, you could get quarters there during regular business hours. Some tolls in Orlando only accept coins. Have a couple dollars of quarters in your car!!!\\n\\n3. Ripoff alert: As other Yelper have mentioned here. Make sure you have car rental contract with you at your return. I declined the gas option because I always refill the gas tank. Review your car rental return receipt against your car rental contract. During my return, the agent hastily charged me $20 extra bucks for failing to refill the gas tank. I immediately challenged the agent at the spot and got the gas charges removed. The agent apologized but it pissed me off because she just charged me WITHOUT telling me. There is a pattern of this unprofessional behavior at this very location.

I rented through costco and going to make a complaint with them also..All these negative reviews are not made up..Budget needs to do something at this airport..I understand it is busy but dont push unnessary stuff like insurance and fight for 10 minutes like they did..Just say ok if you get into an accident you were warned..The car which we got after the return was fine however.  Returning the car was no trouble but i was up all night worried.  Read these reviews and take them seriously.. I wish i had..\": 1.0,\n",

Be prepared for a 90 minute (minimum) wait to get your vehicle only to be told they don't have the one you booked in advance. They will then give you the option of upgrading for double the price of what you previously paid. \\n\\nWhen you return the vehicle, get ready to be rushed out of it so it can get cleaned. Don't forget anything in it because they won't even attempt to help you get it back. They'll act like they're having someone look for it but they never actually do. They'll give you a phone number to call and make a claim so if found it can be mailed to you. It won't ever be found.

            "[\"HECK NO!! Some of the world's lousiest food exist right here in POP dining. The only thing that's edible is their breakfast platter. Everything else, burger, pizza, pasta, is horrifying. The pizza is the worse pizza on Earth. There's barely any cheese, the pepperoni is hard, and the dough, crust is half baked. You can still see the layer of dough that has not been fully baked. The beverage and condiment stations are always a hot mess and often has flying insects hovering around certain sections of each station. \\n\\nThe shopping, everything is overpriced. $10 for a small keychain. The prices are just crazy\\nIt's to be expected but even with your Chase Disney debit card, the 10% discount only applies when you spend $50 or more. \\n\\nVerdict - Shop at a Disney store outlet. As for food, please avoid if you can. Disney dining is the most overrated crap. Don't listen to those YouTube Disney vloggers. Disney dining is garbage but probably fine cuisine for Southerners and hicks from the burbs. Most quick service meals are hot trash and I expect Disney to do better.\", \"The food at Pop Century sucks! I can't believe the kind of food they have. It's disgusting and way over priced for the crap it is. I would have thought that it would be at least good food for being Disney. They over charge everything. You're practically forced to eat there since it's the only food they have there. The cups have a limit of refills and they time your drinks too. My first and last time staying at this resort. I do not recommend this place at all.\", \"This is the gift shop located at Disney's Pop Century Resort and it's a pretty large one.  Love the fact that it's open until midnight.  \\n\\nAll kinds of Disney gifts are here such as items for your kitchen, toys, clothing for kids and adults, D-Tech items (such as cell phone cases, portable battery charges, etc., photo frames, and so much more.  \\n\\nYou'll also find things here you may have forgotten such as shampoo, body wash, razors, toothbrushes, etc.  They even have bathing suits and coverups.  \\n\\nIf you happen to be under the weather during your stay, they have a good variety of medicinal items.  \\n\\nWant to buy your booze by the bottle instead of a drink at a time at the poolside bar?  They sell that here too.  You'll even find the good stuff like Grey Goose.  Keep in mind, you'll be paying Disney prices for the booze!\\n\\nIf your vacation is coming to an end and you need to purchase some last minute gifts, you'll definitely be able to find something here!\", 'If you ever been to Disney you know you start remembering your keepsakes at the last minute. Well if your staying in a Disney Resort your in luck. Here at the Pop Shop located in the Pop Century Resort is a great place to buy all your last minute souvenirs. \\n\\nThe Shop is open till midnight nightly and offers a variety of merchandise, from all sorts of Disney merchandise to pharmacy items. Paying is very easy when you use your key to the world. During the day checkout there pin trading board you can find some cool rare pins.\\n\\nThe cast members are very friendly and make sure to help you find what your looking for. I differently always have a positive experience at this shop.', 'This is a fun little shop at the Pop Century Resort in Disney World.\\n\\nGrab your souvenirs and gift items here - plus toiletry and medicinal items you may need and forgot at home.', \"The perfect place to grab some last-minute gifts for the people who aren't at the happiest place on earth!\\n\\nThey have an assortment of all the classic gifts, pins, magnets, and shirts with a couple surprises. I won't pay $11 for a waffle magnet, but I was sure close. \\n\\nIf anyone related to the pin-making department in Disney is reading this, please expand your offerings of Minnie playing sports. Right now, at Pop, Mickey has baseball, football, soccer, etc and Minnie only has cheerleading. Where my soccer-women at, Disney?! \\n\\nDespite the mild sexism on the pin selection, I encourage browsing this gift shop if you're staying at the resort. You almost have to, though, becuase it's smack dab in the middle of everything.\", \"Really just a giant disappointment. JaMarcus Russell's run with the Raiders was less disappointing then Everything Pop. Do you remember Mars Needs Moms? Or John Carter? Those great Disney Flops are still better than Everything Pop. \\n\\nKids chicken tenders - More breading than chicken. Drier than the Sahara desert. \\n\\nTurkey Sandwich - well it's a turkey sandwich. Nothing special and definitely not great. Acceptable is the best way to describe. Panera, subway, jimmy johns, wawa are all better. \\n\\nAmerican Platter - When Disney says their new biodiesel is run off of food, really what they mean is they use the grease that is left at the bottom of this meal. There is more oil, grease and fat to power the entire fleet of buses. Such a disappointment. \\n\\nMickey-shaped Waffle Platter - Dense ... thick ... heavy ... impenetrable ... awful. \\n\\nDo yourself a favor, get on the skyliner and go to the Riviera. Have all your quick service meals at Primo Piatto.\", \"I stayed here with my family for the second time this year. I love the space (3 bedroom, 2 bath), and proximity to Disney. The only drawback this trip was coming home after a ten hour day at Epcot, and our key not being active any longer. I was riding with my boyfriend, so I left my ID in the room. When I went to the front desk, I was asked for ID, then chided for driving without my license. When I noted I simply drove from behind the check in area at my room's parking lot, he turned up his lip. When I asked why my key deactivated, he said probably because the person who checked me in did so for only\\n2 days, and not 3 days as I paid for (he was the one who checked me in). The floors made my feet dirty (either the carpet or the tiles, not sure which). They ran out of washcloths after taking ours earlier in the day. My son's pillow case kept getting removed from his pillow, the pillow we brought from home. The cleaning staff kept putting their pillow case on his pillow. I will probably stay here again, but not if I can find another hotel for the same price with as much space.\", \"We really loved staying here and it was perfect for everything we wanted. Even with the weird customer service at the end, I'm giving it a 4 stars, for all the positives and benefits!\\n\\nWe love the set up of the villa especially with it being for 4 adults - Me, my hubby, my mom, and dad! We didn't have to be stuck in one hotel room. We had perfect space where we didn't have to be on top of each other. We had a downstairs open living room, dining area, small kitchen, and a bathroom with shower downstairs. The couch  even has a bed in it if one needs it.\\n\\nUpstairs is two bedrooms and an adjoining bathroom with bath tub. One bedroom had two double beds and one bedroom has a king sized bed. The beds were very comfy, the sheets and comforter were cozy. Only thing was the pillows were very small.\\n\\nWe had a view of the creek which was nice and nature-y! The pool was nice along with two small hot tubs which were not hot. They have a park and big grassy area for our dog to play. We were not able to walk the boardwalk and gazebo which looked really nice.\\n\\nAt the end, customer service was weird because the person I called to extend my check out an hour didn't know we existed. He said it was because Booking.com and their system did not communicate. Also, I asked for two towels and they brought us two rolls of toilet paper. I was like What?! At least our receipt matched our quote from Booking.com. \\n\\nAll in all, we loved our clean roomy villa and would recommend staying here.\", 'Excellent accommodations! Stayed here the week of January 26th through January 30th.  2bd/2 bath townhouse; 2 levels.  It was only the hubby and myself so it was way too much space for only two people.  The kitchen came fully stocked with cooking and eating utensils and a full size fridge.  Two bedrooms upstairs with a full bath and a sofabed downstairs with another full bath; shower only. The food from the onsite restaurant ... well, it could have been better.  We ordered hot wings and shrimp alfredo.  The wings seemed to be old and were hard.  The pasta was good however. \\n\\nI will definitely visit Saratoga Resort Villas again.']\n",

Good food.  So, I took to my trusty Yelp app and searched for something good, and Flying Elephants came up as the highest rated place.  When I discovered it was on the wrong (read:other) side of security, I hesitated.  Did I want to deal with running the gauntlet of terrorist-inspired nasty governmental drones to get good food?  Did I want to waste my chance to eat at a GREAT restaurant that is a known quantity (Stanford\\'s) in order to take a chance on a place so many Yelpers raved about?

Since it was about 6:30 PM, some of the entrée\\'s were already consumed, so I went with a tuna melt and some Mac & Cheese.  Immediately after ordering, the friendly counter guy reached into a refrigerator below the counter and pulled out a cellophane-wrapped, pre-made, flat and ugly sandwich thing that made the sandwiches Starbucks makes look positively decadent.  Yuck!  When I mentioned to the counter guy \"I thought you made these when they were ordered\", he told me they were made earlier.  I\\'ve posted a picture of the sign outside Flying Elephants that clearly states \"Great Local Foods From Scratch...\".  From scratch implies they make some stuff now.  By their definition, they could sell Twinkies under the same claim!\\n\\nWhen I got my SMALL sandwich, it wasn\\'t bad.  The Mac & Cheese wasn\\'t bad either.  But I had walked right past Stanford\\'s to come here...and they have a Mac & Cheese that will blow your mind and rocket you into outer space - it\\'s that good.  I felt let down.  I had skipped a chance to have a truly outstanding meal for this.  All things considered, I don\\'t think I\\'ll be back.  If I want a pre-made sandwich, I\\'ll just spend the same amount and get something that looks better and is bigger at Starbucks (and not have to deal with the associated security hassles).

              " 'This place is WORTH going through security screening a second time!\\n\\nMy flight started out of Redmond airport and then had a connection in PDX before I would fly out to Houston. I was researching the various food choices online to see what what I would have to choose from. I had never been to Flying Elephants before but came to conclusion that this would probably be my BEST option. The downside... I would have to go through security again since they are located in the general public area.  *Arrrrgh!!!* I thought to myself--- but having good fuel for the tank is a top priority! \\n\\nSo I decided to give them a try, not only for something to eat while I was there in PDX, but to get a sandwich to eat later on for lunch (since you don\\'t get meals on planes unless you pay for them... and we all know they\\'re not that great either).  \\n\\nFIRST IMPRESSIONS\\n\\nIt seemed much smaller in person than in the photos. I think people did a good job of taking photos from all the best angles, but when I actually got there I though, \"oh wow, it\\'s small!\"  As you can see from the photos there are about two red counch/lounge areas to sit out. They were all full when I got there.  HOWEVER, there is a LOT of seating almost right next to them, that\\'s open to anyone and everyone. \\n\\nFOOD CHOICES\\n\\nI had two goals, first to find something for breakfast and then to find something to take with me on the plane.  A few people took a photo of their sandwich area which is where you can choose from pre-made sandwiches.  If you\\'re just looking for a tasty sandwich I think you\\'re have no problem. I had the more difficult challenge of trying to find an alkaline choice (pretty difficult normally, and VERY difficult at an airport). I noticed \"Shelly\\'s Vegan Wrap\" and was THRILLED to see Kale, Broccoli, cabbage, etc. as the ingredients.   I grabbed one to eat for lunch while on the plane. I took a photo of this as well so you can see what it was like.\\n\\nI wanted to also try their breakfast burrito which they have two options for, vegan or meat (sausage I think?). I went for the vegan option which has beans and chilies in it. It also came with salsa (see photo).  \\n\\n*NOTE* All of their sandwiches were TSA approved and they had a nice sigh there saying so. I\\'m not sure if there any sandwiches that AREN\\'T approved, but as someone who hadn\\'t flown in a while, it gave me full assurance that I wouldn\\'t have to depart with my new found food treasure going through security.\\n\\nTASTE EXPERIENCE\\n\\nThe breakfast burrito was quite good. What stood out to me most is the wrap itself. The texture and taste of that was quite remarkable. Although not a monster burrito in size (like something from Chipotle) I found it to be filling and didn\\'t want to eat anything else. The salsa was nice but nothing remarkable. I like spicy foods but the salsa didn\\'t taste spicy to me.  As far as airport food goes, I thought this was a good value at around $5 (i believe?). I would eat it again, though it\\'s not on the level of food experiences that I would eagerly anticipate the next time I\\'d get one. \\n\\nAfter getting on the plane and about 3 hours later I pulled out \"Shelly\\'s Vegan Wrap\" to try.  My first thought, was \"oh my, how am I going to eat this on a plane.\" It was wrapped really well so it didn\\'t fall apart at all on me, but the contents are lots of little pieces that could fall out on you fairly easily.  I just took my time eating this, and everything worked out fine. No messes, though again, the potential is definitely there if you\\'re not careful. \\n\\nTaste wise, this was actually remarkable!! The wrap itself was delicious, the dressing was subtle and did it\\'s job very well (I don\\'t normally like having dressing on food but this was great). The bits of grape and apple add some sweetness to this meal which went really well with the flavorful bites of kale, carrot, cabbage and broccoli.  I was REALLY impressed with this sandwich for how well they balanced it being something healthy and yet very tasty.  It took we a LONG while to eat both parts, and I was full after finishing them both.  It was perfect, and still fresh even after being in my bag for about 3 hours.\\n\\nADDITIONAL THOUGHTS\\n\\nI\\'m SO GLAD I decided to give this place a try, even though it meant having to go through security again.  Next time I\\'m in PDX, this will be my go-to place and I\\'ll stock up on meals to take with me. \\n\\nI think I scanned the drink area and didn\\'t see anything for me. I pretty much drink water (alkaline if possible) or pure vegetable juices (as in juiced). I believe they had Kamboucha and a few Snapple esque type products. My suggestion for improvement would be to have some water with a pH of 8 or above (I actually found some at another airport!) or coconut water.

It detracted from the excellent balance they had with the grapow.  \\n\\n- The mixed greens they served were a small handful of the type you get at a grocer with no dressing at all.  Just the greens.  Some were wilted.  They were a distraction.\\n\\n- They put two deep fried wonton crisps on top which were overly greasy and didn\\'t have much flavour.  \\n\\nSo overall it seems like they can get good flavours on the main part of the dish (which is no small feat!), and now just need to get the rest of the plate in order to move on up.

I came in solo for lunch one day in the afternoon and was, to say the least, quickly tended to and served by the one server who was the only person I saw on the floor 90% of my 30 minute visit to Bob. \\n\\nLet me just say that this server was on fire! She waited all the tables by herself, transported dishes back and forth from the kitchen by herself, and ensured everyone's glasses were filled with water, taking care to ensure the entire front of house was kept smoothly moving along. She wasn't overly enthusiastic in her demeanor, but she just did her job and smiled occasionally.\\n\\nNow, on to the food. I opted for the green chicken curry with rice lunch special ($12.00), added a spring roll to the meal for $1.00, and also ordered the deep fried tofu ($7.00). The green curry dish was decently portioned and tasted exactly like I expected it to - slightly spicy, coconutty, smooth, yet distinguishably Thai. The curry was excellent and exactly what I was looking for! \\n\\nThe salad that came with the meal seemed cheap, like they went to Save On Foods and just piled a bunch of random pre-washed greens on the plate. The same dressing they put on the salad was the same sauce that was drizzled on the spring roll so I found that kind of boring. The spring roll itself tasted like a spring roll should and was a needed addition to the meal to make up for the sad greens.\\n\\nThe deep fried tofu for $7.00 was a fresh special that I decided to order since I figured I wouldn't be full just from the lunch special. The tofu came out exactly like I thought it would, in six large pieces, served with a sweet dipping sauce. The dipping sauce was a bit too bland for my liking and the tofu was not seasoned at all - it was just straight up plain tofu that was deep fried, but at least it was deep fried well. I probably wouldn't order it again, save the $7.00 and get a second lunch special or something.\\n\\nFor $20.00 (excluding tip), I had a pretty okay meal.

I left with Snickerdoodles, Chocolate Chunk cookies, Raspberry Thumprint cookies, Pecan Tassies and 1 each of the chocolate, vanilla and red velvet cupcakes. Also tempting me was the case full of beautiful pies and cakes, scones and brownies. Really, good heavens, there was so much to choose from! The gentleman who took my order on the phone was very helpful, as was Ms. Sister Honey who was there when I picked up. Very, very nice people. \\n\\nOnto the baked goods- they are worth every carb and calorie! The Chocolate Chunk cookie is a revelation. Chocked full of massive semi sweet chocolate chunks, this is a special cookie. It wowed all of the gals who tried it, as did the deliciously cinnamony goodness of the Snickerdoodle. The Raspberry Thumbprint was amazing, the moist cookie was oatmeal based and the filling was fruity and not too sweet. The cupcakes are a \"regular sized\" version and especially good. The vanilla cupcake was moist, not too dense and tasted like- wait for it, actual vanilla. Not yellow cake, vanilla bean. The Red Velvet cupcake was DELICIOUS. A moist, buttermilk based red velvet cake with great flavor topped with amazing cream cheese frosting. If you like Red Velvet, get down there.

Dotted with a few raisins and the most perfect cream cheese frosting- my mom and husband were thrilled, as carrot cake is their favorite dessert.

            "[\"Elephant's contacted me the same day I posted my original review to follow up on my experience.  Wow!  They left a very nice message verifying that the PDX location does participate in ALL of their punch cards, including coffee and cookies.  Also, they said that they're reviewing this with all of their staff, so something like this doesn't happen in the future.  Thanks Elephant's!\", \"I'm not usually a fan of airport food. I usually like to arrive and get to where I need to go. However, I had no choice this past weekend on our first trip to Portland but to stay at the airport for four hours and wait for my boyfriend's flight to arrive. I was hungry and this place seemed popular compared to the other surrounding food areas. I got their weekly special french dip sandwich, not really expecting much except to fuel my stomach but was surprised how good it was! It had the meat with au ju, mayo, chipotle, and blue cheese. Wish I had time to get a sandwich before we headed home.\", 'If one must have breakfast at the airport, perhaps due to hangover reasons, Flying Elephants makes a pretty good breakfast burrito. I felt that their beans were, for lack of a better word, pleasingly beany (legumy?) which helped settle my stomach on a rough morning.', \"Reasonably priced, tasty local joint. Lots of goodies you would see at the Flying Elephants downtown as well as the original Elephant's Deli. Beers for pretty cheap compared to a typical restaurant. Food is fresh. Probably one of the best places you can get non-airport food in an airport!\", 'Other than my own store, this is my go-to airport restaurant over the last four years. Fresh food, lots of allergy-friendly options, and a really kind staff. Their soup is amazing, particularly the Elephant Cure, the  Nigerian Peanut Soup, and the Dill Pickle Soup. Also, a full wall of delicious drinks ranging from kombucha to soda to alcohol.\\n\\nOther foods to look for: their curry, Ratatouille, and the pastrami sandwich.', 'The worst experience at Flying Elephant ever.  The \"hot breakfast\" food was mediocre, at best. Burnt; dry; bland and it took forever to get.  I\\'m hugely disappointed.  I\\'ve been to this location before as well as other and used to love it and arrived at the airport early just to eat here.  Boo. :(', 'This is the best place at PDX to get breakfast. I love their quiches and their pastries. They are placed before security, so make sure you have enough time to finish all your drinks!', \"Oh, geeze, I must've gotten there too early or had a new barista.  I ordered an espresso americano and it was worse than a fast food joint.  I complained that it was too weak but no offer to remake or add another shot.  Bummer!\", \"It isn't often I praise airport food, but Flying Elephants is so good I wish there was one locally so I could lunch there all the time. I had the BEST ham and swiss baguette there this trip: smoky, salty ham, strong swiss, a brush of dijon and mayo on fresh chewy bread.  I agree with other reviewers that the place needs to be on the other side of Security. Even a sandwich/soup kiosk there would be great.\", 'such a cute place! goodies of all sorts from candies to cookies to coffee. deli food and drinks but also loved that they cooked warm food. this was perfect for an early morning breakfast before catching our flight back to san diego.']\n",
